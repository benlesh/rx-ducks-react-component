# rx-ducks-react-component
A ReactJS component helper for reducing boilerplate while using rx-ducks-middleware and Redux

** WARNING: This is experimental and very alpha

### Install

NOTE: This has peer dependencies of `react`, `rxjs` and `redux`. Those must be installed
seperately. Check the `package.json` if there is any confusion.

```sh
npm i -S rx-ducks-react-component
```

### Usage

For now, check integration test 1 in the (very small) test suite. This is subject to a
lot of change at the moment.
